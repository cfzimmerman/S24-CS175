### List of all files you submitted:

`asst3.cpp` and `rigtform.h`

### Note the platform you used for development (Windows, OS X, ...):

`M1 Mac`

### Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

I used Xcode

### Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

Yes

### Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

I mostly followed the lecture notes. The only real design decision was refactoring my rotation and movement functions from pset 3 to be more understandable before starting on this pset.

### Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

It should follow the assignment spec.

### Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.

No
